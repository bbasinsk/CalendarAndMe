# Calendar & Me

## https://bbasinsk.github.io/CalendarAndMe/
Our application helps busy individuals plan and schedule events. With our application, users can seamlessly integrate with Google Calender to display visual calendars of all users in a group in order to view other users' availability. Users can also create group events that are displayed on all group members' calendars.
